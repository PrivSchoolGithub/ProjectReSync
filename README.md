## What is SyncAdmin?
SyncAdmin is a <a href="https://www.roblox.com">Roblox</a> cloud based game management system originally developed in 2015 that allows you to create your own plugin commands with its very own <a href="https://developer.polymatic.co/c/SyncAdmin/API">developer API</a> so you can create plugins which fit your games specific needs without needing to write hundreds of lines of code.

## Key Features
**We sync your settings automatically!**
With SyncAdmin, all settings are automatically synchronized across all games. This means when you ban someone, they're banned on all servers instantly, modifying permissions instantly apply to all other running servers, etc.

**Want to show off your plugins? You can!**
SyncAdmin's plugin format allows you to create and share your plugins with other game developers. We have a collection of awesome plugins you can install for your game on Github and via the Roblox Studio toolbox all created by the community.

**Don't know how to script? No problem!**
SyncAdmin is designed to work out of the box, this means that you simply insert SyncAdmin into your game, turn on HttpService and publish your game. All settings are edited in-game from the settings panel and saved to the cloud.

**If that isn't enough, we're working to add even more features in the near future with SyncAdmin 2.0.0.beta!**
