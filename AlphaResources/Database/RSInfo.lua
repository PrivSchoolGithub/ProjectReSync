Basic History
<EXIT TEXT BOX>
<RESET FONT>
The concept of ReSync dates back to 2016 with the creation of Anna and Marcy's Synchronized Administrative Commands. The system came to be known as "SyncAdmin" (because who wants to say "Synchronized Administrative Commands a bunch of times?) and was copyrighted under the British company Polymatic Labs Limited. SyncAdmin was a favorite of many Roblox users because of its sleek GUI and easy-to-use plugin system for developers. Additionally, SyncAdmin was utilized by multi-thousand member groups such as Soro's Restaurant and Jamie's Restaurant Franchise, making it a popular choice among group owners and development teams. Perhaps one of SyncAdmin's largest flaws was their overzealous producers going to great lengths to protect their source code. We at Studio Engi understand the importance of keeping source code private, but that was a highly debated issue of SyncAdmin, one that ultimately caused their downfall.

We modeled ReSync after another product because it shut down and we wanted to remake it.

Advanced History

<RESET FONT>
When Roblox announced that it would no longer be providing support for private ModuleScripts, many developers either switched to obfuscated code or simply terminated their service altogether (ie, Terabyte Services). Fortunately, SyncAdmin switched to a complex obfuscation system, thus keeping their product alive for some time, at least. However, after one known exploiter reverse engineered, decompiled, and released SyncAdmin's internal source code, the company decided to discontinue maintenance updates, which were regularly required in order to keep the system running on a consistent basis. A limited copy of the obfuscated code was provided upon the service termination. to Finally, on November 1st, 2019, Polymatic Labs entirely discontinued all their services and relinquish claims to the company, thus rendering it completely dissolved. Further information about Polymatic Labs Ltd. and SyncAdmin can be found in internet archives, company logs, and DevForum posts for those of you who are interested. The original developers deleted most of their social media (Twitter, Github, and I believe YouTube?), but posts and videos by other developers and people who have used their services remain.

SyncAdmin shut down because they couldn't keep their code private.
