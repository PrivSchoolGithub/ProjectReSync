__A Note to Developers__

The resources contained within this folder are deprecated items that were a part of the initial alpha testing build that can be used as a reference point, mainly for Project ReSync creators. No support will be provided for the modification of these resources, and we provide no guarantees of any functionality whatsoever (In fact, most of these scripts were abandoned part of the way through and don't work at all). It is not recommended that you utilize these resoures for future development. Please refer to the latest build update if you're interested in creating your own plugins.
