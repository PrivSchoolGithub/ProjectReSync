    I. What is ReSync?
    ------------------
	ReSync is an all-in-one game assistant, plugin manager, and administrative commands
	system for your Roblox games.
    
	a) History
		The concept of ReSync dates back to 2016 with the creation of Anna and Marcy's
    Synchronized Administrative Commands. The system came to be known as "SyncAdmin" 
    (because who wants to say "Synchronized Administrative Commands a bunch of times?) 
    and was copyrighted under the British company Polymatic Labs Limited. SyncAdmin
    was a favorite of many Roblox users because of its sleek GUI and easy-to-use plugin 
    system for developers. Additionally, SyncAdmin was utilized by multi-thousand member 
    groups such as Soro's Restaurant and Jamie's Restaurant Franchise, making it a popular
    choice among group owners and development teams. Perhaps one of SyncAdmin's largest 
    flaws was their overzealous producers going to great lengths to protect their source
    code. We at Studio Engi understand the importance of keeping source code private, but 
    that was a highly debated issue of SyncAdmin, one that ultimately caused their downfall.
    
		When Roblox announced that it would no longer be providing support for private 
	ModuleScripts, many developers either switched to obfuscated code or simply terminated 
	their service altogether (ie, Terabyte Services). Fortunately, SyncAdmin switched to a 
	complex obfuscation system, thus keeping their product alive for some time, at least. 
	However, after one known exploiter reverse engineered, decompiled, and released
    SyncAdmin's internal source code, the company decided to discontinue maintenance 
    updates, which were regularly required in order to keep the system running on a 
    consistent basis. A limited copy of the obfuscated code was provided upon the service 
    termination. to Finally, on November 1st, 2019, Polymatic Labs entirely discontinued 
    all their services and relinquish claims to the company, thus rendering it completely
    dissolved. Further information about Polymatic Labs Ltd. and SyncAdmin can be found in
    internet archives, company logs, and DevForum posts for those of you who are interested.
    The original developers deleted most of their social media (Twitter, Github, and I 
    believe YouTube?), but posts and videos by other developers and people who have used
    their services remain.

    III. Account Help
    -----------------
    As stated previously, ReSync offers the option to sync your settings across all your 
    games.
    To create an account, all you have to do is join the following place and enter some 
    quick information:
    <LINK>
    Important Notes About Accounts:
    -------------------------------
    + You can have multiple accounts, but it's not recommended. You can separate your 
      settings between certain games or groups with a single account.
    + All accounts must be verified by support before they can be used. This means that any
      inappropriate usernames will be flagged, and you will be restricted from using ReSync
      until such time that your restriction is appealed.
    + ReSync will store your password in a secure database, but our support staff will not 
      have access to view this information (aside from MasterScootScoot, the database 
      developer). ReSync staff will never ask you for your password, as we can perform 
      moderation actions on your account without logging in under your name. This means that
      anyone asking you for your password is a fraud that is attempting to steal your 
      account. If you happen to forget your password, you may contact us to reset it for 
      you. Our staff will never access your account unless:
		a) You give us your expressed consent
		b) You or your account has been flagged for suspicious activity
    + If you have multiple Roblox accounts and want to use only one ReSync account, you can
      do that! Just check the box when creating your account that says "Use 2-Factor 
      Authentication." You can always change that information later in your account 
      settings. Note that if you skip this step, it is critical that you do not give ANYONE 
      your password.
    + We at Studio Engi understand how important it is to protect the loss of data. The 
      system is designed in a way so that you may access your saved settings from other 
      Roblox accounts, or games not owned by you. If you happen to lose access to your 
      Roblox account, ReSync is not liable for the loss of data. However, if you've saved 
      your settings Key, you'll still be able to access them. If you're verified under your
      old account in the Studio Engi server, DO NOT VERIFY YOUR NEW ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU HAVE 
      SPOKEN WITH SUPPORT!! We will only access your account and reset your password and 
      delete your game settings for you if you can verify that you are the account owner.
      Otherwise, there is a security risk in doing so, and we will NOT reset your 
      information.
    + Due to Roblox limitations, your account unfortunately can't be 100% secure. We'll take
      responsibility if our system is breached, but as stated in the Terms of Use, it is 
      your responsibility to keep your account with us secure. This means ensuring that you 
      trust your developers, as any game developer will have access to view these scripts, 
      and therefore your account information and potentially your Keys if you've placed that
      information here. You should try to keep your Keys as private as possible and only 
      share them on a need-to-know basis. Please remember that if you need to reset your 
      Keys at any time, you may feel free to change them from the Project ReSync Database. 
      If your Key(s) is used by someone else you shared it with without your consent, we 
      will be able to reset it for you, providing that you can confirm your ownership of 
      the account in question.
    + All of this information and more can be found in the Database. If you still have 
      questions or you're just lazy and didn't want to read this, feel free to contact 
      consumer support. We will try to assist you as best we can... but we'd really
      rather that you just read the information if possible.

    V. Terms of Use/Service
    -----------------------
    a) Introduction
		Welcome to the Terms of Use and Terms of Service section of the About script, also 
	known as "the icky stuff that nobody actually reads but we can refer to if someone 
	breaks the rules." In other words, this is a guide on how to use our product safely 
	without infringing on our rights as developers. You'll also find here a list of your 
	privileges (yes, it IS a privilege to use ReSync and yes, it CAN be taken away, despite
	what you may think) under our jurisdiction. For all intents and purposes, this is not a
	legal document, but it contains the rules you must follow if you don't want to be 
	banned from using ReSync. We've reviewed it and tried to make it as loophole-free as 
	possible.
    b) Definitions
		For all purposes in this section of the document (below section V) and below point 
	a, the following definitions, regardless of case, may be used to mean the following 
	terms (An indent is used to indicate the continuation of the previous line, and any text
	in parentheses following the closure of the immediate parentheses is considered 
	commentary and is not a part of the definitions or any content below section V of this 
	document, excluding point a):
    "THE DOCUMENT" or "RULES" or "REGULATIONS" - Refers to any content below section V of 
     this document, excluding point a
    "CODE POLICIES" - Refers to point c of the document
    "DEFINITIONS" - Refers to this point of the document (point b, not this sentence, silly)
    "PUNISHMENTS" - Refers to point e of the document
    "RESYNC" or "PRODUCT" - Refers to the software
    "WE" or "US" or "OUR" or "DEVELOPER" or "WE'RE" - Refers to the owners of the software: 
     MasterScootScoot, 0bBinary/EngiAdurite, and the official ReSync support team. We're 
     means "we are" in this case (And really, in all cases.)
    "YOU" or "YOUR" or "YOU'RE" - Refers to the person using this software: yourself, the 
     user. You're means "you are" in this case (And really, in all cases...)
    "ONLINE" - Refers to the World Wide Web
    c) Code Policies
		The most fundamental rule we have is, put simply, "Don't be a jerk." This 
		encompasses many things, from spamming our
    e) Punishments
	Ah, the best part! Yes, this is what happens to those who possess no integrity and 
	honor. Penalties for breaking rules will be listed in order of severity, from best case
	scenario to worst. Think of it like accidental misdemeanor to first degree felony.
	1) Spamming the Endpoint
	    We consider this breaking the number-one rule of "Don't be a jerk." Yes, we realize
	some of our code is stored in public resources online. If you're curious about them,
	feel free to ask a product developer or do some simple experimentation with code, 
	provided you're in compliance with our Code Policies. Don't send more than one request 
	per five seconds to our endpoint or ReSync's Roblox data storage. There's a reason the 
	settings have a timeout interval. We're not going to judiciously monitor all incoming 
	traffic, but if we get a gazillion requests and the system begins to lag, we may look 
	into it. An accidental or single-time offense will result in a reminder. Continued 
	misbehavior will result in a warning that will be logged, and continued refusal to 
	change or remove the item causing excess traffic will result in a ban from our service. 
	The length of the ban is up to the discretion of consumer support.
	2) Being a Jerk in Your Own Game
	    Your game is your game! We'd rather you not banish all of consumer support, 
	loopkill your players, and troll everybody, but 
	that's up to you. This point was just included to make sure you know that you can feel 
	comfortable playing your game as long as you're in compliance with all other rules and 
	regulations. :>
	-) Support Discretion
		talk bout loopholes here and how people shouldnt try to use them cause they get 
	banned anyway
