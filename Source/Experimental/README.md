- A late version of Alpha based on the structure intended for Beta testing.
- Separate from the other Alpha resources that were deprecated and will not be utilized in further tests.
- Mostly kept as a safety net to fall back on in the event that Beta tests fail.
- It is not recommended to use this code as your main source, since updates are no longer being pushed to it.
